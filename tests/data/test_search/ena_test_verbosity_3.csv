Cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, the dishes submerged in a reservoir of liquid nitrogen for 10 s, transferred to dry ice and 400 µl of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide and 25 U/ml TURBO™ DNase (Life Technologies)] dripped on. Cells were scraped extensively to ensure lysis, collected and triturated with a 26-G needle ten times. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 g at 4 ºC, the supernatants recovered and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysates were subjected to RiboSeq and RNASeq. The methodologies employed were based on the original protocols of Ingolia and colleagues (Ingolia et al., 2009; Ingolia et al., 2012), except ribosomal RNA contamination was removed by treatment with duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) for Samples 7 and 8, and library amplicons were constructed using a small RNA cloning strategy (Guo et al., 2010) adapted to Illumina small RNA v2 to allow multiplexing.

Methods Enzymology 194: 795). Between 3x10E8 and 12x10E8 cells were resuspended in 100 ul of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM Mg2Cl, 1 % Triton X-100, 100 ug/ml cycloheximide) with 1 g of chilled glass beads (Biospec) and lysed using a Fastprep 24 bead-beater (MP Biomedicals) at level 6 for 13 seconds. The extract was diluted with 400 ul of lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation in two steps at 4 degrees C at 16,000 g (5 minutes followed by 15 minutes). 600 A260 units of cell extract were digested with 750 units of RNase I (Life Technologies) for 45 minutes. Reactions were quenched with 600 units of SUPERaseIn (Life Technologies). Digested extracts in 500 ul were loaded onto a 14 ml linear 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared with a Gradient Master (Biocomp), and separated by centrifugation for 160 min at 35,000 rpm in a SW 40Ti rotor (Beckman). The gradients were then fractionated by upward displacement with 55% (w/v) sucrose, and fractions containing monosomes selected for further processing. RNAs were then purified by phenol extraction, passed through amicon ultra 100 kDa columns (Millipore), and run on 15% TBE-urea gels (Life Technologies). Fragments of around 28 nucleotides were extracted from the gel.

The gradients were then fractionated by upward displacement with 55% (w/v) sucrose, and fractions containing monosomes selected for further processing. RNAs were then purified by phenol extraction, passed through amicon ultra 100 kDa columns (Millipore), and run on 15% TBE-urea gels (Life Technologies).

Digested extracts in 500 ul were loaded onto a 14 ml linear 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared with a Gradient Master (Biocomp), and separated by centrifugation for 160 min at 35,000 rpm in a SW 40Ti rotor (Beckman). The gradients were then fractionated by upward displacement with 55% (w/v) sucrose, and fractions containing monosomes selected for further processing. RNAs were then purified by phenol extraction, passed through amicon ultra 100 kDa columns (Millipore), and run on 15% TBE-urea gels (Life Technologies). Fragments of around 28 nucleotides were extracted from the gel. Gel purified RNA fragments were treated with 10 units of T4 PNK (Thermo Fisher) in a low pH buffer (700 mM Tris pH 7, 50 mM DTT, 100 mM MgCl2) for 30 min at 37C.

To create Dox-inducible cell lines, we first transduced HeLa cells with MSCV-rtTA3-IRES-EcoR-PGK-Neo (pRIEN), a retrovirus we constructed in the MSCV backbone (Clontech) to co-express an improved reverse transactivator (rtTA3), the ecotropic receptor, and a neomycin resistance marker. Following G418 selection, stably rtTA3-expressing cells were subsequently infected ecotropically with a second retrovirus expressing a puromycin resistance gene and a TREtight-driven transcript encoding GFP alone (pTt-IGPP) or GFP and either full-length mouse or zebrafish Unkempt protein, or any of the mouse Unkempt-deletion mutants (pTtight-X-IGPP, where X is an ortholog or mutant of Unkempt), which we constructed in a self-inactivating retroviral backbone (pQCXIX, Clontech). To induce transgene expression, double-selected cells were treated with doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 micro-g/ml. To determine the effect of Unkempt on the rate of protein synthesis, we performed ribosome profiling experiment on inducible HeLa cells essentially as described (Ingolia et al., Nature Protocols, 2012), but using the linker and the primers as for the iCLIP experiments (Konig et al., JoVE, 2011). GFP-only or GFP and Unkempt-inducible Hela cells were grown in 15 cm dishes and harvested at 70% confluency.

Arabinose was added to 0.1% 10 minutes before harvesting the cells to induce the expression of RyhB. Then cells were harvested by pretreatment with chloramphenicol to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for 2 minutes followed by rapid filtration by using a 500ml 0.45um PES filter system (Celltreat). Cells were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen together with 0.65 ml lysis buffer (Oh et al. 2011). The frozen cells were pulverized 6 times at 15 Hz for 3 min by a mixer mill (Retsch MM400). The grinding jars were re-chilled in liquid nitrogen to keep the cells frozen between each cycle. After the pulverized cells were recovered, small scoopful was saved for bacterial transcript enrichment. Footprinting and monosome isolation were performed as described (Oh et al. 2011). Briefly, the pulverized cells were thawed. The clarified lysates were treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Worthington Biochemical Corp). Monosomes were isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation. mRNA footprints were purified with acid phenol and chloroform extraction, and isopropanol precipitation. Both ribosomal footprints and total mRNAs were converted into cDNA libraries as described (Ingolia 2010, Oh et al. 2011) with modification. The RNA molecules were dephosphorylated by treating with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs).
