Recombinant MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) was derived as previously described (Coley et al., 2005). 17Cl-1 cells (10^7) were plated in 10 cm dishes and, upon reaching 70-80% confluence, were infected with MHV-A59 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 PFU/cell (or 200 PFU/cell in the High MOI experiment - samples 37-39) in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 50 mg/ml DEAE-dextran and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 45 min at 37 oC, the inoculum was removed and the cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 oC until harvest. At the appropriate time point, cells were treated with CHX (Sigma-Aldrich; to 100 g/ml; 2 min), or HAR (LKT laboratories; 2 g/ml, 3 min) then CHX (to 100 g/ml; 2 min). Cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, the dishes submerged in a reservoir of liquid nitrogen for 10 s, transferred to dry ice and 400 l of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 g/ml cycloheximide and 25 U/ml TURBOTM DNase (Life Technologies)] dripped on.

Recombinant MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) was derived as previously described (Coley et al., 2005). 17Cl-1 cells (10^7) were plated in 10 cm dishes and, upon reaching 70-80% confluence, were infected with MHV-A59 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 PFU/cell (or 200 PFU/cell in the High MOI experiment - samples 37-39) in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 50 mg/ml DEAE-dextran and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 45 min at 37 oC, the inoculum was removed and the cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 oC until harvest. At the appropriate time point, cells were treated with CHX (Sigma-Aldrich; to 100 g/ml; 2 min), or HAR (LKT laboratories; 2 g/ml, 3 min) then CHX (to 100 g/ml; 2 min). Cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, the dishes submerged in a reservoir of liquid nitrogen for 10 s, transferred to dry ice and 400 l of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 g/ml cycloheximide and 25 U/ml TURBOTM DNase (Life Technologies)] dripped on.

Collected cells were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryogenically pulverized by mixer milling (Retsch). Pulverized cells were thawed and clarified by centrifugation. Resulting lysates were digested with MNase, quenched with EGTA and resolved by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Ribosome-protected mRNA footprints were processed as previously described in Becker et al.(2013) Nat Protoc 8(11):2212-2239. Sequencing library was prepared as described in Oh et al.

ZIKV strain Pe243 (ZIKV-PE243) was derived as previously described (Donald et al., 2016). At 24 h p.i., cells were treated with CHX (Sigma-Aldrich; to 100 µg/ml; 2 min). Cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, the dishes submerged in a reservoir of liquid nitrogen for 10 s, transferred to dry ice and 400 µl of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide and 25 U/ml TURBO™ DNase (Life Technologies)] dripped on. Cells were scraped extensively to ensure lysis, collected and triturated with a 26-G needle ten times. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 g at 4 ºC, the supernatants recovered and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysates were subjected to RiboSeq and RNASeq. The methodologies employed were based on the original protocols of Ingolia and colleagues (Ingolia et al., 2009; Ingolia et al., 2012), except ribosomal RNA contamination was removed by treatment with duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) for Samples 7 and 8, and library amplicons were constructed using a small RNA cloning strategy (Guo et al., 2010) adapted to Illumina small RNA v2 to allow multiplexing.

Methods Enzymology 194: 795). Between 3x10E8 and 12x10E8 cells were resuspended in 100 ul of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM Mg2Cl, 1 % Triton X-100, 100 ug/ml cycloheximide) with 1 g of chilled glass beads (Biospec) and lysed using a Fastprep 24 bead-beater (MP Biomedicals) at level 6 for 13 seconds. The extract was diluted with 400 ul of lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation in two steps at 4 degrees C at 16,000 g (5 minutes followed by 15 minutes). 600 A260 units of cell extract were digested with 750 units of RNase I (Life Technologies) for 45 minutes. Reactions were quenched with 600 units of SUPERaseIn (Life Technologies). Digested extracts in 500 ul were loaded onto a 14 ml linear 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared with a Gradient Master (Biocomp), and separated by centrifugation for 160 min at 35,000 rpm in a SW 40Ti rotor (Beckman). The gradients were then fractionated by upward displacement with 55% (w/v) sucrose, and fractions containing monosomes selected for further processing. RNAs were then purified by phenol extraction, passed through amicon ultra 100 kDa columns (Millipore), and run on 15% TBE-urea gels (Life Technologies). Fragments of around 28 nucleotides were extracted from the gel. Gel purified RNA fragments were treated with 10 units of T4 PNK (Thermo Fisher) in a low pH buffer (700 mM Tris pH 7, 50 mM DTT, 100 mM MgCl2) for 30 min at 37C.

To create Dox-inducible cell lines, we first transduced HeLa cells with MSCV-rtTA3-IRES-EcoR-PGK-Neo (pRIEN), a retrovirus we constructed in the MSCV backbone (Clontech) to co-express an improved reverse transactivator (rtTA3), the ecotropic receptor, and a neomycin resistance marker. Following G418 selection, stably rtTA3-expressing cells were subsequently infected ecotropically with a second retrovirus expressing a puromycin resistance gene and a TREtight-driven transcript encoding GFP alone (pTt-IGPP) or GFP and either full-length mouse or zebrafish Unkempt protein, or any of the mouse Unkempt-deletion mutants (pTtight-X-IGPP, where X is an ortholog or mutant of Unkempt), which we constructed in a self-inactivating retroviral backbone (pQCXIX, Clontech). To induce transgene expression, double-selected cells were treated with doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 micro-g/ml. To determine the effect of Unkempt on the rate of protein synthesis, we performed ribosome profiling experiment on inducible HeLa cells essentially as described (Ingolia et al., Nature Protocols, 2012), but using the linker and the primers as for the iCLIP experiments (Konig et al., JoVE, 2011). GFP-only or GFP and Unkempt-inducible Hela cells were grown in 15 cm dishes and harvested at 70% confluency.

Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml polysome extraction buffer (1 % deoxycholate, 1 % NP40, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 350 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 250 uM cycloheximide, 1x protease inhibitors (Sigma, P8340) and 2 ul RiboLock RNase inhibitor (ThermoFisher). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 16000 xg and supernatant (leaving lowest ~25% behind) was used for ribosome profiling.The lysate samples were split in to two different digestion samples and digested with either 200 U of E. coli MBP-RNAse I (New England BioLabs) or 100 U of MN (ThermoFisher) by incubating for 40 min (U2OS) or 60 min (Kc167) at RT with slow mixing. 2 U of DNase I (ThermoFisher) was also added to each U2OS sample at the start of digestion. MN reaction was stopped with 10 mM EGTA. The samples were centrifuged at 6000 xg for 5 min to pellet insoluble material.

Arabinose was added to 0.1% 10 minutes before harvesting the cells to induce the expression of RyhB. Then cells were harvested by pretreatment with chloramphenicol to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for 2 minutes followed by rapid filtration by using a 500ml 0.45um PES filter system (Celltreat). Cells were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen together with 0.65 ml lysis buffer (Oh et al. 2011). The frozen cells were pulverized 6 times at 15 Hz for 3 min by a mixer mill (Retsch MM400). The grinding jars were re-chilled in liquid nitrogen to keep the cells frozen between each cycle. After the pulverized cells were recovered, small scoopful was saved for bacterial transcript enrichment. The pulverized cell powder was extracted with acid phenol and chloroform followed by isopropanol precipitation as described (Oh et al. 2011). 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs were removed by subtractive hybridization using Ambion MICROExpressTM kit following manufacturer&apos;s manual. The enriched mRNAs were randomly fragmented as described (Oh et al. 2011) Both ribosomal footprints and total mRNAs were converted into cDNA libraries as described (Ingolia 2010, Oh et al. 2011) with modification.
